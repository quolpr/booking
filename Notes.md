To mention:
1. I put a lot of effort on validation, cause I think it's very critical for UX
2. I didn't use DTO or service inputs, but usually I do
3. I didn't think match about renaming and following ubiquitous language, usually I speak with bussines t pick better naming. Maybe instead of order - booking/reservation entity should be, I am not sure
4. I also didn't think about better models structures due to need more communication with bussines
